# Test Portfolio
Following a presentation from [Beth Marshall](https://mobile.twitter.com/beth_askher) at the [Ministry of Testing - TestBashX Edinburgh](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbashx-edinburgh-2022) conference, I was massively encouraged to put together a Test Portfolio.

The goal is to create a repository of useful and reusable test projects. This will serve as a journal of my personal development, with snippets of reusable code, as well as a method of demonstrating my work to colleagues or potential employers.
